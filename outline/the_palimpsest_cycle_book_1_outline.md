# Characters

## Penelope “Penny/Pen”

- **Role:** Licensed **ruin‑runner** for the Antiquities Guild; saving to found her own charter so she can stop paying the Guild’s tithe and get away from the guildmaster’s sleazy gaze and plot for her.
- **Drives:** Autonomy, competence, protecting her found family (crew). She wants choices that are hers.
- **Borrowed instincts (not omniscience):** At strange moments she hears **voices she doesn’t recognize** that nudge her; her body moves with **unearned muscle memory**; luck bends around her at the worst times. She rejects “fate” as an answer.
- **Wound:** Neglectful, distracted parents who drifted into a devotion cult. Pen distrusts anyone who speaks the language of destiny, omens, or fortune.
- **Arc:** From rejecting any story larger than herself → co‑authoring a story that refuses to own her.

## **August** "Just. August." 

- **Public mask:** Veteran ruin‑runner with a reputation for burning partners when they stop being useful; feared for chasing power others won’t touch. Keeps Pen at arm’s length (enemies‑to‑lovers), even as he quietly keeps tabs “for the plan.”
- **Private truth (kept secret for most of Book 1):** As a young man he found an **impossible book** in a buried chamber—a fairy‑tale of a goddess and a mortal—that detonated his mind with **lifetimes**. He has fractures (dissociation, hallucinations of Pen as _not‑Pen_, slips where he calls her the wrong name). We treat his mental illness with care and dignity.
- **Goal:** End the cycle permanently so he—and she—can finally rest; he’d end everything if it’s the only way to end _him_.
- **Arc:** Learns, through Pen, that it hurts because it’s precious and fleeting. Learning to live to love and be loved, even when it's painful.

## Antagonist / Tragic Prime — **The Reset Sovereign**

- **Nature:** Less a person than a devouring rite—a dark goddess/protocol of endings that consumes worlds. It manifests an **avatar** resembling Pen (it takes on a similar form to whatever version present in that timeline), but the true Penelope‑Prime has eroded under centuries of resets and atrocities committed in the name of one lost love.
- **Goal:** Reabsorb the fragment that became Pen and “correct” the world into stillness where nothing can be lost. Holds jealous fury for whatever version of Pen is with the MMC; enrages when he fails to match her warped memory of the man she once loved.
- **Harbingers (the Four):** apocalyptic lieutenants with distinct aesthetics and set‑piece arcs. They come into existence unbound by the curse and actively plot to "summon" the Sovereign through whatever means necessary (performing a ritual using Pen as a sacrifice exists is also a way to bring her forth, but just getting them to meet and interact creates the energy needed to summon her and is preferable as the goal is for the Sovereign to absorb Pen)

## Key Supporting Cast

- **Lisbeth “Liss”:** Pen’s alchemist best friend; psuedo-mother / older sister vibe.
- **Armen**: childhood friend of Pen and part of her "running crew", has an unrequited crush on Pen and believes they'll always be together
- **Captain Veyra Hask:** Guard officer torn between law and survival; wary ally.
- **Guildmaster Vorkress Nines**: Seedy, conniving man rumored to have risen to guildmaster through nepotism and bribes.
- **The Archivist:** A strange, clumsy old man who always knows more then he lets on. Calls Pen by a strange name but is kind so she is fond of him. Collects odds and ends sold to him from guildmembers, and is most interested in documenting historical discoveries. is actually another deity, but not in the cosmic or powerful sense. As I sort of illuded to in "The Curse - Rules of the Cycle" the archivist is immortal and persists through the ending and creation of each new world. Their purpose and existence is to document history as it unfolds
- **The Destined (cult):** Devotion sect that venerates the Sovereign’s arrival despite not knowing her true identity, form, or anything. They believe the world's state is the way it is due to humanity's inherently evil souls and believe accepting the Sovereign as your savior purifies you and makes you a "Destined one" who will live beyond the Sovereign's eventual coming.

# World Bible — A World of Ruins

The Host: A city-settlement built within a grander civilization’s bones. Streets dogleg around collapsed auditoria; civic halls repurpose ancient cathedral shells; whole neighborhoods are built from a combination of stone and wood, old and new. The public thinks in terms of rebuilding, not resets.

### Sensory Detail & Atmosphere

- **Textures**: The city is a patchwork of survival—rough stone ruins grafted with timber, beams wedged into ancient arches, walls patched with scavenged planks and bits of metal. Every surface tells a story of adaptation: splinters where wood meets stone, moss creeping over both, nails hammered into places they were never meant to go. The beauty here is not in symmetry or grandeur, but in the stubborn, creative will to rebuild. The city’s tactile landscape is a living metaphor for rebirth and redeath—each repair a callback to the cycle at the heart of the story.

- **Crust**: The upper class is a parody of nobility—velvet drapes hung over cracked walls, polished silverware set on tables made from scavenged doors. Perfume and wax try to mask the ever-present scent of dust and decay. Their airs and rituals are a desperate performance, pearls on a pig, clinging to status in a city that is barely more than a survival camp.
- **Crumb**: The slums are honest about their hardship—mud, sweat, patched roofs, and the press of bodies. The people here live in the reality of The Host, facing dangers and deprivation that should have faded as the city grew, but persist because the Crust hoards resources, backed by the king’s soldiers. The Crumb’s textures are raw: rough blankets, cold stone, the constant ache of hunger and hope.

- **Magic in Hartia**: Magic is not a marvel, but a background hazard—like climate change, its effects are everywhere, but rarely remarked upon. The world is saturated, warped by the residue of a long-ago war. Floating islands blot out the sun, plants and animals mutate unpredictably, and the landscape itself is a palimpsest of old and new. For most, magic is not a source of wonder, but a reminder of loss and danger. Pen, having only known The Host and its ruins, may notice the strangeness more than others, but even she is numb to much of it. There are no spells to hum, no magical scents—just the constant, invisible pressure of a world forever changed.

- **Antiquities Guild:** Licenses ruin‑runners; skims heavy; looks the other way on “unsavory acquisitions ” if paid.
- The Crust: Higher society and "noble born" peoples that live in the governmental district of The Host. Made up of a hierarchal set of families always seeking higher status. At the top sits the Duke who represents the Warlord King of the lands surrounding the city. Uses forces supplied by the king to enforce taxes, levies, and control, especially on the lower class.
- The Crumb: Slums, people turn to the dangerous task of Running to scrape by, or by ganging up on other vulnerable groups for extortion

Hartia: the previous great civilization named this side of the Spikepeaks (mountain range) "Hartia", as learned from artifacts scavenged by Runners. The current king didn't bother changing it after his brutal rise to power. Hartia is a large chunk of the continent, set aside by the Spikepeaks to the west, the seemingly neverending plainlands to the north, and a coastline that spans from east to south to the Great Sea. Hartia is dotted with small villages with deep historical roots that were united by the current king through brutal raids-until-you-submit tactics, with larger settlements being taken early before they could develop any semblance of united government. The two primary "cities" are similar to The Host but fared significantly better in the downfall of the previous civilization and thus could be rebuilt easier, they are Versci and Ramos. The latter being renamed after the king when he made it the seat of his kingdom, though most people just call it "the capital"

Hartia is home to a small variety of species, with humans being the most common. There are the Rexis who resemble our world's reptiles but if they evolved alongside humans, the Faeta whose long and lankey forms are heavily covered by cloth but still manage to move about with such grace they seemingly float above the ground, the Hort whose stout bodies skin glisten and glitter like precious stones, and finally the Runte whose forms vary like the animal kingdom they resemble and shift back and forth between. The Host is not known for its variety of species, but is dotted with the rare non-human. The Rexis' homeland is the Spikepeaks alongside the Hort who dwell within them, Runte come from the plainlands but, due to their nomadic nature, don't have a specific place of origin they care to mention. The Faeta being the oddities in that they seem to have an equal root in Hartia as the humans due to them always having existed in these lands as far as living memory can capture, they seem to gather at the capital and rarely leave the city walls.

Magic permeates the land across Hartia as if spread by an oil spill. The results on the environment is substantial from the found documents from the previous civilization. Many of the animals and plants they categorized cannot be found but the current flora and species resemble them a bit, like they went under hundreds of years of evolution but the previous civilization existed 3 generations ago. These mutations resulted in an increased danger of roaming the land as one could accidently run into what can only be categorized as a monster all too easily. Not just on the life itself, but the effect on the environment is palpable. Hartia is home to several floating islands, the main one being large enough to blot out the sun as it sets in the right conditions. This eclipse like event is celebrated with flashballs (fireworks) and is used to mark the beginning and end of solstices. While some have found success using the Magic to create wonders and miracles, it is incredibly rare and is primarily relegated to fairytales and myth due to its difficulty and physical strain. The occasional magical circus performed by travelling Runte bands being the exception, however even in this case, the usage of Magic is more for entertainment and novelty than practical application. Much safer to depend on steel than spend years mastering a single spell.

# The Curse — Rules of the Cycle

As documented by the Archivist:

1. **Creation**: A new universe is born, exploding out of the collapse of time and space and scattering across the dark expanse of The Beyond. Sometimes it takes Trillions of years, sometimes it takes thousands but eventually a suitable environment for life to begin and evolve. Eventually a species develops a large enough nervous system to achieve consciousness, and may become the dominant species and reproduce en mass.
2. **Reincarnation**: There seems to be some threshold that must be met regarding the level of consciousness of the dominant species before the birth of one of those two. If I had to guess, and excuse the romantic in me, it would be once the species has the capacity to experience love.
3. **Attractor:** Their souls are magnetized; they always meet. They're not always born at the same time, my longest recorded gap between them would be what you would know as 5 years, and almost never in the same place. But none of these factors matter, as they will always, through unplausible odds, meet each other. One could mark their meeting as the beginning of the end.
4. **Catalyst:** Their initial meeting seems to be some kind of signal as upon its occurrence, as those 4 arrive through the same origin point the universe was born in shortly after. They move to wherever the lovers are living and adapt to the environment by taking the forms of the dominant species and spend a period of time integrating. Integration takes different forms based on which of the 4 you're observing.
5. **Reaction**: After integrating, the 4 waste little time making progress towards their goal. I have observed two main routes they take: perform the ritual on the goddess' incarnate or drive them towards each other until enough "signal" is generated to bring HER. Those 2 always put up a good fight though but ultimately, she always makes a spectacle of her arrival.
6. **Trinity:** All three of them have arrived, she does her investigation of the heroes' incarnate, puts him through trial after trial to test his likeness. If he does not meet her mysterious standard, she throws a fit and begins to consume.
7. **Heroics**: To stop her, they must unite—and one of them dies. Always. Or they both do and she doesn't stop until the universe is one with her, I usually black out for awhile when this happens but then we're back at step 1. I haven't decided which one is worse: watching her consume everything or watching the despair the one left behind experiences.
8. **Wipe:** Whether she is defeated and banished, or consumes the entirety of reality, we always end up at the end eventually. My records are full of documented history long after both of the two have been long dead in timelines where she is defeated, I like when that happens.

~~**9**~~. **Leak:** ??? wait what? Where did that **book** come from? What have they done to him!?

**Breaking Hypotheses (MMC’s chart):**

- ~~Bargain~~
- ~~Beg~~
- ~~Hide~~
- ~~Kill self~~
- Wipe out reality before she does, her along with it

# Artifacts & Lore Seeds

- **The Impossible Book**: a fairytale of the goddess who fell in love with the mortal hero, but when he died, she became the goddess of death to be with him forever - a fairytale book that originated from the Prime timeline
- **The Four Harbingers:** Envy, Lust, Greed, Wrath
- **The Archivist’s Bookshelf:** an infinite number of books, handwritten documentation of every universe, every timeline, every version of these events since they began. All from the Archivist's perspective
- **Romance Barrier:** Pen doubts whether he loves **her** or all the **hers** he sees inside her. His slips (wrong names, hallucinations) fuel the doubt.

# Book 1 Outline — Raw

Book 1:
Act 1 - Introduction to characters, setting, show what Pen's "normal" life looks like, show how she treats her friends, how she deals with problems like the guildmaster, how she handles the clear class divide in The Host. Introduce August, show their mutual distain but clear sparks she doesn't show with other characters, Act ends with a conflict among her "crew" - Armen heard of a great score at ruins outside the city, when pressed he reveals his source is from a ranking member of The Destined, he presses that they should go for it anyway and that it could be the push they need to finally get their charter. Pen is skeptical but when Armen drops the F word - "fate" - she completely refuses and expresses their need to just stick with what they know, where its controlled, where it is safe. Pen recalls her parents involvement with The Destined with a wince. Armen mutters something about going without her before leaving in a huff. After their fallout, Armen has been acting strange and fidgety. In order to get some space from the crew she visits an old friend of hers - The Archivist, a hermit who lives just beyond the cities' limits within an extremely old section of the ruins. He consults her about the matter and gives some elderly wisdom about the matter. However his tone changes a bit when August's name gets brought up by Pen offhandedly and he questions her about what she knows about him and how many times they've met. Pen finds this odd but answers the questions because she trusts the hermit but his expression doesn't seem to get any lighter after hearing her answers. The Archivist ends up telling her that Armen came by for a map which he found strange since Pen is usually the one to drop by, not to mention the map he was looking for charted a very dangerous place. Pen recognizes that the map is to the out of town ruin and realizes Armen took off by himself to find the treasure.
Act 2 - Pen chases after Armen (I think Armen being a year or two younger than Pen makes sense here, she's worried about him like an older sister, he's trying to impress her like a younger man after an older woman), in her haste Pen only leaves a passing remark to Liss about where she's going before leaving. While exiting town, she bumps into August for another round of bickering, this time ending with August to slip and call her a different name. She gets more upset by this than she expected and continues off in a huff to chase after Armen. We get to show what the ruins look like and a bit of the outside world beyond The Host as Pen travels towards her destination, fighting some monsters and navigating some dangers a long the way. When she arrives, Armen isn't in sight and she debates going into the ruin herself or if she should wait here for the others. Pen realizes she never actually asked anyone to come after her and begins making her way into the ruin when she hears a voice she doesn't recognize say "Behind you!" Pen dodges out of the way of a cloaked figure trying to knock her out with a brick. She draws her shortsword and tries questioning him, to which he doesn't seem to react at all. In response, the cloaked figure lets out an unworldly whistle / shriek and after a moment a chimera appears behind it, seeming to listen to its will. Pen and the chimera fight a hard battle, but Pen manages to beat it with a bit of wit and dexterity. She notes the way she is moving being different than her usual battle movements, certain movements she's never done before feeling natural and effortless. Exhausted she turns to face the cloaked figure and realizes she's actually been completely surrounded by other cloaked figures. Before she can react, someone from behind pulls a burlap sack over her head and inside are an herb mix that causes her to begin to lose consciousness. The last thing before she completely fades to black is the feeling of being dragged in the direction towards the ruins.
Act 3 - Pen awakens, hearing another strange unfamiliar voice calling out to her, hands bound inside a decrepit but functional jailcell deep within the ruins. As she takes in her surroundings, she makes out the sound of chanting coming from up the stairs. Frightened she begins trying to free herself from her binds, accidently kicking something in the darkness that creates a sound. Reacting to the sound, she hears someone move towards the bars and say something about her finally being awake. She recognizes the voice and as the cloaked figure approaches the bars and comes into view, its revealed to be Armen gleefully looking down at her. She asks why hes doing this, confused and rattled. He reveals to her that unbeknownst to her, he had become very involved with The Destined for quite sometime now. He bitterly says she'd know that if she paid any bit of attention to him, complains about how he never gets noticed by her and how he deserves her love for sticking by her for as long as he has. She rejects him, calling him a traitor and a cultist. He is angered by this and forces a kiss, beginning to ramble on about how they're destined to be together and how the church promised him she would be his if he joined them and did what they asked. As he begins to become more physical with her, she manages to swing a foot into his crotch causing him to double over in pain. Pen tries to wiggle out of her restraints more but Armen gets up and raises his hand to backhand her, but he's interrupted by a voice from the top of the stairs telling him to stop. A deep guttural voice that sends chills down her spine. Pen sees the same cloaked figure she originally fought outside the ruins. It introduces itself as Envy, one of the 4 and asks if that name means anything to Pen. Pen says no and demands to be released. Envy smiles at her and says she'll be released soon enough - a sentence with a double meaning here. He turns to Armen and says that preparations are complete and to bring the Fated (referring to Pen) to the main chamber before leaving to ensure everything is ready. Armen leads her up stairs by her binds, and she sees the sacrificial chamber full of cloaked figures clearly trying to look like Envy as much as they can. She begins to be lead to the raised platform when a loud clanging is heard at the far end of the chamber and a tapestry is accidently set on fire by the fallen over candlestick. Everyone in the chamber turns to look, reacting to the sound and the sudden heat. Pen sees her chance and deftly moves behind Armen, lifting her binds up and around Armen's face, notching them in his teeth. In the same motion, she gets both her feet up onto the arch of Armen's back and pushes with her legs as hard as she possibly can. The already thinned binds snap across Armen's now busted up teeth which he holds and howls in pain. Pen doesn't stop, using the momentum from the push off of Armen, she makes a mad dash to the door. She doesn't know which way is out, but she needs to get as far away from here as she can. She has to juke and roll through 2 cultists who try to grab her and can hear Envy shouting to grab her and bring her back immediately. She makes it through the corridor, and continues through the tunnels, picking her best intuition on which way to go to get towards the surface. Several voices guiding her on which way to go, even arguing amongst themselves about which way to go is best. When she suddenly bumps into a figure causing them both to fall from the recoil, and she feels something like electricity discharging into the air from just their brief contact. She looks up to see August, and panics for a moment thinking he's with the cultists. August immediately says "there you are!" and calls her an idiot for coming out here alone, saying how he felt something was off when she was in such a hurry to leave The Host so he followed her path and saw her being dragged down here. Pen's having trouble thinking straight, the heat in her cheeks rising and many of the voices now sound like a beautiful ringing melody in her ears. August snaps her out of her daze and says to follow him to get out of here, we'll go back the way he came in. She immediately becomes suspicious but as she begins to refuse, she hears an extremely audible voice that sounds a lot like her own say "Trust him." Reluctantly, she nods her head and they begin making their way out. As they breach the surface, Envy is already there waiting for them along with several cultists. He says something about of course it being August who foils his plans and that things never seem to change. He begins to preach about Destiny being fulfilled when Pen hurls a nearby rock directly at his face. The provocation causes the cultists to begin to charge the pair when August unleashes a volley of fire magic, instantly striking down all the small fry, Pen is in awe as she's never seen magic before let alone heard about such an intense use of it. The attack only seems to graze Envy but now it is just him and the two alone. August hands Pen two daggers saying something about how she prefers these right? Pen holds the daggers awkwardly in both hands, having never used anything between a knife and a shortsword before so she's confused by what August could be referring to her preferring daggers. She and August battle against Envy, whose true form becomes more revealed as August and Pen land blow after blow, their teamwork strangely immaculate. Eventually Envy's true form is revealed, a monster made of darkness and shadow. Envy laments his frustration at not being able to perform the ritual this time around, almost like it's a game to him, but says it won't matter in the end since August and Pen seem to be getting along so well together. August winces at this, Pen continues to be confused by what everyone else is talking about. Envy says a final piece about how he actually is pretty jealous of them before his body begins to inflate and expand. He laughs maniacally and says he'll be going out with a bang this time. August realizes what's about to happen and pulls Pen close to him and creates a barrier around them. Pen feels that electric sensation again as their bodies push tightly together to brace for the impact. Envy's explosion sends the pair flying off in a random direction and the book ends.
epilogue: Pen and August are shown to have been blown to one of the floating islands around Hartia. Pen is pushing August for answers and August keeps shutting her down. The epilogue ends as Pen demands an answer as to what the hell that was all about and why everyone is talking like they all know something she doesn't. August reveals their reincarnation cycle and how they're connected, fade to black.
