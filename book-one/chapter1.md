## Chapter 1 — _The Runner’s Life_

The first rule of ruin-running was simple: **don’t breathe too loud**.

Even now, Pen knelt in the throat of a broken cathedral. Its ribs had collapsed. The altar lay fractured by time, root, and soot. She reminded herself of that same old rule as she pressed her back to cold, weeping stone.

A drip fell from the ruined ceiling. Somewhere above, a creaking strut groaned like a dying animal.

Pen exhaled slowly.

Behind her, Lisbeth crouched. Her loose braids were tucked beneath a patched hood, and she already had a vial in hand. To the right, Armen — younger, jittery — checked his climbing claws for the third time in as many minutes. His breath misted in the damp air. His boots slipped slightly on the slick stone. At the rear, Dren stood watch, pressed into shadow with an ease that unsettled even Pen at times.

They were in Section K-9, an unnamed ruin beneath what might once have been a civic square. Now it was just another cratered street, warped by centuries of sunken city and failed rebuild. Pen had mapped it herself over three previous dives, convinced this vault hadn’t been picked clean.

So far, she was right.

“Clear ahead,” she whispered, then eased forward on all fours beneath a hanging arch of snapped rebar. Her gloves were thick leather, but she still felt the bite of rust and age through the seams.

The corridor curved into darkness. Others had crawled through this wound in the world, but if her map was right, they hadn’t done it quietly.

Above them, dozens of feet and centuries away, the Host stirred. The city sat on a graveyard of itself. Every cobblestone had another beneath it. Every building stood on foundations laid long before. The place had always been more corpse than castle. Pen had grown up in its Crumb—the honest half, where dust was just dust, not draped in velvet and forced to pretend it meant something.

She reached the tunnel’s end and stopped.

“Vault edge,” she whispered.

Liss crawled up beside her. “You sure this is the right one?”

Pen gave her a look. “If it’s not, you can bury me with my pride.”

Liss smirked. “You say that every run.”

Pen drew a chalk stub from her pouch and marked the stone lip: a crescent with a dash through it. Her own code. If she didn’t make it back, someone else might find it and know how far she’d come.

The room beyond was enormous. A collapsed dome hung overhead like the roof of a rotten fruit. It cracked in multiple places, tree roots punching through the stone like grasping fingers. Moonlight filtered through the ruin in broken stripes that divided the space into slices of shadow and silver.

Pen paused to adjust her eyes.

Carved stone plinths lined the edges of the room. Each one held relics of a forgotten world: shattered pottery, warped bones, fragments of metalwork she couldn’t name. The air tasted of dust and copper.

She stepped inside.

The others spread out. Liss catalogued samples. Armen drifted toward a half-buried statue. Dren had already vanished into the far wall like a ghost.

Pen felt it then. The old thrill.

This was where she came alive.

Not in the Host’s markets. Not at the Guild’s counting tables. Not inside some Crust noble’s dusty parlor pretending not to notice how fast her heart beat. Here, in stale air and uncertain light, she felt like herself.

She crouched beside a cracked urn, brushing debris aside with a gloved hand. Inside: a bundle of scrolls, perfectly sealed in wax. Her heart kicked against her ribs.

“Liss,” she called, voice tight with excitement.

Before her friend could answer, a sharp crack echoed from across the chamber.

Pen’s head whipped toward the sound.

“Shit!” Armen shouted. His arms flailed as a section of the stone dais beneath him gave way.

The floor buckled.

Pen launched toward him. Chunks of stone tumbled as a column sheared at the middle, sending an avalanche of debris in all directions.

“Liss! Catch that vial!” she shouted.

Liss dove and cradled her pack. Dren had already disappeared from sight.

Armen scrambled backward. His foot caught in a gap. He flailed, and for one split second, Pen didn’t see Armen at all.

She saw another boy. Pale. Gaunt. Furious. Eyes the wrong color.

Then the moment passed.

She dove, yanked Armen free by the collar, and slammed into the base of a statue with him just as a slab crushed the place where he’d stood.

Dust roared through the room. Pen coughed. Her lungs burned.

“Are you trying to die?” she hissed.

Armen blinked up at her. “I thought I saw something—some kind of glyph under the tile—”

“You thought with your feet.”

“I... thanks. I didn’t mean to mess it up—”

Pen pushed herself upright. “Then stop treating every run like it’s your chance to impress someone.”

Armen flushed. “That’s not what I—”

She walked away.

The chamber had mostly stabilized by the time they regrouped. No one was hurt. A few relics had been lost to the collapse. But Pen had moved just in time.

Which was the problem.

She wasn’t supposed to move like that. She hadn’t seen the slab. She hadn’t even thought about it. Her body had just known.

Again.

Back above ground, the air reeked of coal and cooked meat. The Crumb was alive now. Children darted under broken carts. A fishmonger hawked three kinds of not-quite-fish from a rusted wheelbarrow.

The crew climbed the slope toward the Guild checkpoint. The Guild headquarters stood like a squat parasite, grafted into the bones of something once magnificent. Stonework arches, defaced by time, sat awkwardly beneath banners and reinforced steel. They hadn’t built the structure. They’d simply stapled their name to it.

Inside, a clerk flipped through their salvage sheet with greasy fingers. Vorkress Nines wasn’t present—thank the gods—but his underlings were.

“Three-hour run?” the clerk muttered. “Form 23B.”

Pen handed over the ledger.

The man leafed through it. “Brass dial. Function?”

“Unknown,” Pen said. “It resonated near iron. We logged it.”

“Mm.” He made a mark. “Class two hazard. Guild cut increases to seventy percent.”

“Seventy?” Pen’s tone flattened.

“Processing fee. Magical irregularity. You know the rules.”

“Right,” she said. “You certainly do.”

They watched the haul vanish piece by piece into the Guild’s storerooms. The runners who risked everything earned barely enough to keep the lights on.

By the time they left, Pen’s jaw ached from clenching it.

“Someday,” she muttered, “I’m going to found my own charter. No tithes. No velvet parasites. No Vorkress.”

Liss smiled. “And no annoying younger brothers?”

“Especially not those.”

Armen didn’t laugh.

Their safehouse was a converted bell tower. No bell. No roof. Just tarps, splintered beams, and a view that made the city look almost survivable.

They split what little they’d been allowed to keep. Dren vanished, as usual. Liss sat cross-legged, eyeing the dial with a lens.

Pen reclined on a pile of scavenged blankets and drank from a battered flask.

“So,” Liss said, “you planning to gut Armen next time, or just humiliate him again?”

“He’s lucky I pulled him out.”

“You’ve said that before.”

“I meant it.”

“You always do, especially when you’re scared.”

Pen stiffened. “I wasn’t—”

Liss raised an eyebrow.

“Maybe a little,” Pen admitted.

Armen sat alone. He sharpened a blade that was already sharp. “I didn’t mean to screw up.”

“I know,” Pen said.

“I thought… you’d think it was cool. Finding something first.”

“That’s not your job. Your job is coming back.”

“I could do more if you let me.”

“It’s not about permission.”

He stood and stepped closer. “Why do you always treat me like I’m still a kid?”

“Because sometimes, you are.”

His eyes softened. “I’d do anything for you. You know that, right?”

“Don’t.”

“Don’t what?”

“Don’t try to make this something it isn’t.”

He looked away. “It could be.”

She didn’t answer.

Liss didn’t say a word, either. The silence that followed was enough.

---

That night, after the others had gone quiet, Pen sat alone.

The brass dial pulsed faintly under her fingers. Not light. Not sound. Something subtler. It was like a heartbeat in her palm.

She turned it once. It clicked.

The city breathed outside. Flashballs burst across the skyline. The Crust was celebrating something again. Probably a birth, or a wedding, or just the fact that they weren’t in the Crumb.

Pen leaned back. Her shoulder ached. Her mind buzzed.

Again, she had moved before thinking. Again, something in her knew what was coming.

She reached into her footlocker and pulled out a charter form.

Half-completed.

At the bottom: Charter Name. Blank.

She stared at the page.

Then froze.

Someone had spoken.

Not a thought. A whisper. Just behind her ear.

> “You always come back here.”

She turned sharply.

No one was there.
