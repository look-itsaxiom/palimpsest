# Book 1 - Act 1 - Chapter 1: The Runner's Life

The rope bit into Pen's palms as she lowered herself through the crack in the ancient floor, her boots finding purchase on the crumbling edge of what had once been a grand staircase. Three generations ago, this had been someone's home—maybe even a palace, judging by the fragments of colored glass still clinging to the window frames like broken teeth. Now it was just another ruin to strip for anything worth selling.

"Easy down there, Pen," Liss called from above, her voice echoing off the weathered stone walls. "I can hear you breathing hard from up here."

"I'm fine," Pen muttered, though her heart was hammering against her ribs. The drop was deeper than she'd expected, and the shadows below seemed to swallow her torchlight whole. She'd been running ruins for five years now, but the darkness still made her skin crawl.

The rope went slack as her feet touched solid ground. She pulled her torch higher, casting wavering light across a chamber that made her whistle low under her breath. Murals covered every inch of the walls—faded but still vibrant enough to show scenes of people in flowing robes gathered around what looked like ceremonial fires.

"What've you got?" Armen's voice drifted down, tight with excitement. At nineteen, he was the youngest of their crew, all lean muscle and eager energy that reminded Pen of a hunting hound straining at its leash. His sandy hair always seemed to catch the light, and he had the kind of easy smile that made tavern girls blush.

"Murals," Pen called back, running her fingers along the carved stone. "Good condition. The Guild'll pay well for documentation of these." She pulled out her sketching pad and charcoal, working quickly to capture the style and subject matter. The Antiquities Guild paid by the piece for anything that helped them understand the civilization that had built Hartia before the great collapse, but they paid even better for intact artwork.

Satisfied with her hand drawn depiction, she put away her materials and surveyed for any passageway that hadn't been collapsed by the passage of time. The chamber branched off in three directions. Pen chose the middle passage, following the beam of her torch through a corridor lined with small alcoves. Most were empty, but she found a few ceramic vessels that had somehow survived three generations of scavengers. She wrapped them carefully in the cloth padding from her pack, checking each one for cracks before stowing them away.

"Pen!" Liss's voice carried an edge of urgency that made Pen's head snap up. "Company topside. Looks like Crust."

Pen cursed under her breath. The last thing they needed was some noble's brat deciding to play at ruin-running on their territory. She'd seen it before—rich kids from the governmental district who thought exploring ruins was some kind of romantic adventure, at least until they ran into their first mutated creature or unstable floor.

She made her way back to the rope, stuffing her finds into her pack as she climbed. The ascent was harder than the descent, her muscles burning as she hauled herself up hand over hand. By the time she emerged into the pale afternoon light, sweat was beading on her forehead despite the cool air, and several black strands had escaped her braid to frame her face.

Liss was crouched behind a chunk of fallen masonry, her alchemist's satchel within easy reach. At twenty-six, she was only three years older than Pen, but she carried herself with the confidence of someone who'd been mixing volatile compounds since she could hold a beaker. Her dark hair was braided back from her angular face, revealing the small scar on her left temple where a glass explosion had caught her during her apprenticeship. She had the kind of understated beauty that snuck up on people—sharp cheekbones and intelligent dark eyes that missed nothing.

"How many?" Pen whispered, settling beside her. Where Liss was all angles and precision, Pen had inherited curves that no amount of practical clothing could completely hide. Her leather breeches fit snugly over hips that had been the subject of more than a few appreciative glances in taverns, though her fitted vest and the short sword at her hip made it clear she wasn't interested in casual attention.

"Three. Two guards and someone in silk who's definitely never done manual labor in their life." Liss nodded toward the ruins' main entrance, where three figures were picking their way through the rubble. "The silk one keeps pointing at things and talking about 'historical significance.'"

Pen squinted at the group. The guards wore the blue and gold livery of one of the Crust families, though she couldn't tell which one from this distance. The third figure was young, maybe Armen's age, with elaborately styled golden hair that probably took their servant an hour to arrange each morning.

"We could wait them out," suggested Jace, their fourth crew member. He was sitting with his back against a broken column, cleaning his fingernails with a dagger that had seen better days. At thirty-one, he was the oldest of their group, with prematurely gray streaking his brown hair and laugh lines that spoke of better times. The scar that ran from his left ear to the corner of his mouth gave him a roguish look that he played up shamelessly when it suited him. "Let them poke around, get bored, go home to their soft beds."

"And lose a full day's work?" Pen shook her head, tucking the escaped strands of black hair behind her ears. "We can't afford that."

The truth was, they needed every coin they could squeeze from this run. The Antiquities Guild's tithe took forty percent of everything they brought in, and that was before they paid for supplies, equipment repairs, and the bribes that kept Guildmaster Vorkress from assigning them the worst territories. Pen had been saving for three years to buy her own charter, but at this rate, she'd be middle-aged before she could afford it.

"I'll handle them," she said, standing and dusting off her knees. Her leather breeches were patched in three places, and her boots had been resoled twice, but they were good quality underneath the wear. She'd learned early that looking like a proper runner got better treatment than looking like a street thief.

She made her way through the ruins, stepping carefully over loose stones and twisted metal. The Host was built within the bones of the old civilization, streets and buildings grafted onto whatever remained of the ancient structures. Sometimes Pen wondered what it had been like before the collapse—if the people who'd lived here had any idea what was coming, or if they'd gone to bed one night in a world of wonders and woken up to find it all ash and ruin.

"Excuse me," she called out as she approached the group. The guards' hands moved to their weapons, but the young noble turned with a bright smile that made Pen stifle a wince.

"Oh, wonderful! You must be one of the locals. I'm Cael Rhine-Masci Thorne, of the Thorne family?" She said the last part like a question, as if Pen might have missed the importance of the name. "We're conducting a survey of historical sites for my comparative studies thesis."

Pen bit back her first three responses, all of which would have gotten her in trouble with the Guild. "I'm afraid this site is currently under active excavation by a licensed crew. You'll need to submit a request through the Antiquities Guild for access."

Cael's smile faltered slightly. "I was told this area was open to the public for educational purposes."

"Told by who?" Pen kept her voice level, but her hand drifted to the short sword at her hip. Academic or not, claim jumpers were claim jumpers.

"Well, I... that is, I assumed..." Cael's face was going red in a way that suggested she wasn't used to being challenged. "Do you know who my father is?"

"Should I?"

One of the guards—a thick-necked man with scars on his knuckles—stepped forward. "Show some respect, runner. You're talking to the daughter of Duke Thorne's cousin."

Pen couldn't help herself. She laughed. "The cousin? I'm impressed. So you're related to someone almost important."

The guard's face darkened, but before he could respond, Cael grabbed his arm. "It's fine, Marcus. We'll... we'll file the proper paperwork." She shot Pen a look that could have melted iron as she and her group turned away.

They retreated with less dignity than they'd arrived with, the guards muttering under their breath about how runners should know their place. Pen watched them go, then turned back to find her crew standing at the entrance to the ruins, Armen bouncing on his toes with barely contained energy.

"Think they'll be back?" Liss asked.

"Maybe. But not today." Pen shouldered her pack. "Come on. We've got work to do."

They spent the next three hours systematically clearing the ruins, working from room to room demonstrating the practiced efficiency of a crew that had been together for two years. Armen stumbled upon a cache of metal tools from what had probably been a workshop, their edges still sharp despite the years. Jace discovered a hidden compartment containing a collection of small jade figurines that would fetch a good price from the right collector. Liss documented everything in her meticulous hand, noting locations and conditions for the Guild's records.

Pen found herself drawn back to the murals in the deep chamber. The scenes showed what looked like festivals or celebrations—people gathered around fires, dancers with flowing scarves, musicians with instruments she didn't recognize. It was beautiful work, and more importantly, completely intact. The Guild scholars would pay handsomely for detailed documentation of cultural practices from the old civilization. She couldn't help but wonder what it must be like to have lived in a place where art and celebration were part of everyday life, rather than something scavenged from the ruins of a forgotten world.

The walk back to The Host took them through the outer districts where the city's patchwork nature was most obvious. Ancient stone foundations supported walls of newer timber and scavenged metal, creating a maze of narrow streets that doglegged around collapsed buildings and repurposed ruins. The air smelled of smoked meats and spices, underlaid with the perpetual dust that seemed to settle on everything in the outer reaches.

This was the Crumb, where the city's poorest residents eked out a living in the shadow of the old civilization's grandest structures. But even here, children played in the ruins of what had once been a great amphitheater, their laughter echoing off cracked marble steps. Women hung laundry from lines strung between broken columns, the bright fabric a sharp contrast to the weathered stone. One just had to not look too long down the alleyways that disappeared into darkness, or the street corners where thugs and scam artists moved just a little too freely.

Pen had grown up here, in a two-room apartment built into what had probably been a storage vault. Her parents had worked as day laborers when work was available, picking through ruins for anything worth selling to the Guild or the private collectors who operated in the city's gray markets. She remembered being five years old and helping them sort through fragments of pottery and broken jewelry, learning to tell the difference between worthless debris and pieces that might feed them for a week. It was almost a happy memory.

"Guild post's buzzing," Jace observed as they entered the lower market district. Sure enough, there were more people than usual hanging around the building where runners came to register their finds and pay their tithes. Clusters of license-holders stood in tight groups, voices low and urgent.

"Something's got everyone stirred up," Liss noted. The runner community was small and tight-knit, bound together by shared risks and the Guild's iron grip on their livelihoods. News traveled fast, especially bad news.

They made their way through the market, past stalls selling everything from fresh bread to ancient artifacts of questionable provenance. Pen nodded to familiar faces—other runners, merchants who bought finds on the side, information brokers who sold maps and rumors for the right price. This was her world, built on the bones of the old one, held together by determination and hope and the stubborn refusal to give up.

As they approached the Guild post, Pen caught sight of a figure leaning against the far wall adjacent to the entrance. August stood with his arms crossed, wavy auburn hair falling across his forehead in a way that suggested he'd been running his hands through it—a habit she'd noticed during their few previous encounters. He was tall and lean, with the kind of build that spoke of years spent hauling rope and climbing through ruins, but there was something in the set of his shoulders that suggested he carried burdens heavier than scavenged goods.

Even from a distance, she could see the careful way he held himself apart from the crowd, like someone who'd learned never to get too close to anything. His face had the kind of sharp-edged handsomeness that would have been devastating if not for the shadows that seemed permanently etched around his green eyes. When their gazes met across the square, there was a flicker of something in his expression. Recognition? No, something deeper for that moment before he looked away with deliberate casualness.

That look did something strange to her pulse, the same way it had every time they'd crossed paths over the past few months since they first met. August had a strange softness in his gaze that betrayed the rudeness in his words when he looked at her, and it never failed to set her teeth on edge.

August was well known in the tight circle of licensed runners in The Host. He went through crews faster than most runners went through rope, and his reputation for abandoning anyone who slowed him down was infamous. However, there was an undeniable skill that kept him in demand among those who needed a runner who always seemed to return with valuable finds and without a scratch.

"Trouble?" he asked as they approached, but his voice was carefully neutral, almost cold. Up close, she could see the fine lines around his eyes that spoke of sleepless nights and the way his hands trembled slightly before he shoved them into his pockets.

"Nothing we can't handle," Pen replied, matching his cool tone though something in her chest tightened at his obvious effort to maintain distance.

August gave a sharp nod and pushed off from the wall, but instead of falling into step with them, he moved in the opposite direction. "Good," he said without looking back. "Stay out of trouble, Penelope."

The way he said her name rang in her ears. The way he said it meant something, like it hurt. It made her want to call him back. But he had already disappeared into the crowd, leaving her staring after him with questions she couldn't voice.

"What was that about?" Armen asked, frowning.

"Nothing," Pen said quickly, but Liss was watching her with knowing eyes.

They entered the Guild post, where the nervous energy from outside seemed even more concentrated. The building had been a temple once, its high ceilings and elaborate stonework still visible beneath layers of Guild bureaucracy. Pen found an empty table near the back of the hall and spread out their documentation—maps, sketches, and the careful inventory Liss had maintained throughout their run.

The bureaucrat who reviewed their paperwork was a thin, nervous man named Cherrick who'd been processing runner documentation for longer than Pen had been alive. His fingers were permanently stained with ink, and he had a habit of muttering under his breath as he worked through each form.

"Territory assignment... correct. License verification... in order. Find documentation..." He paused, examining Liss's detailed sketches of the murals. "Excellent work. Very thorough."

"Is there a problem?" Pen asked.

"No, no. Quite the opposite, actually. These are some of the finest cultural documentation we've seen from the outer ruins." Cherrick made a note in the margin of his ledger. "The Guildmaster will be very pleased with the quality of your work."

Something in his tone made Pen's skin crawl, but she kept her expression neutral. "We aim to maintain professional standards."

"Indeed. Well, everything appears to be in order." Cherrick stamped their forms with unnecessary force. "Your tithe comes to two gold sovereigns and eight silver marks."

Pen counted out the coins, trying not to wince at how much of their earnings disappeared into the Guild's coffers. After equipment costs and supply replacement, they'd have enough left over to eat for the rest of the week and maybe save a few coppers toward their charter fund.

As they gathered up their paperwork, Cherrick cleared his throat. "One more thing. There was an incident report filed this afternoon regarding unprofessional conduct toward a member of the Thorne family. Guildmaster Vorkress would like to speak with you about it."

Pen's blood went cold. "When?"

"Tomorrow morning. His office, first bell after dawn." Cherrick's smile was filled with yellowed teeth. "I'm sure it's just a formality. The Guildmaster likes to... address these matters personally."

They left the Guild post in silence, walking through the early evening crowds toward the tavern where their crew usually gathered after a successful run. The streets were busier now, filled with people heading home from work or emerging for the night's entertainment. Lanterns cast pools of yellow light across the cobblestones, and the air was rich with the smell of roasting meat and fresh bread.

"Pen." Liss fell into step beside her, voice low. "Vorkress has been looking for an excuse to get his hooks into you for months. And now that noble brat just handed him one."

Pen knew Liss was right. Guildmaster Vorkress was a man who'd climbed to his position through a combination of political connections and careful blackmail, and he'd made no secret of his interest in having Pen work more closely with him. His version of "closer cooperation" typically involved late-night meetings in his office and promises of better territory assignments in exchange for favors she had no intention of providing.

"Maybe we should think about taking a vacation," Jace suggested. "Visit my cousin in Versci for a few weeks. Let whatever this is blow over."

"Run away, you mean," Armen said, his voice sharp with disappointed pride. "That's your solution to everything."

"My solution is staying alive long enough to spend the money we earn," Jace shot back. "You might want to consider the benefits."

"Enough," Pen said quietly, but with enough authority to cut through their argument. "We're not running. We haven't done anything wrong, and we're not going to act like we have."

The tavern was a converted section of what had once been a public bath, its high ceilings and elaborate tilework now warmed by hearth fires and filled with the comfortable noise of conversation and laughter. Pen found a table in the back corner, where they could talk without being overheard, and ordered a round of ale and whatever the kitchen was serving.

As they ate, she found herself studying her crew as they bickered, laughed, and shared stories. Armen with his eager energy and dreams of adventure, still young enough to believe that wanting something badly enough was the same as being able to achieve it. Jace with his scarred hands and careful cynicism, who'd taught her more about reading people than only a lifetime of betrayals could. Liss with her quiet intelligence and unshakeable loyalty, who'd stood by her through every crisis and celebration of the past two years.

These were her people. Her family. And if Vorkress thought he could use some trumped-up complaint to force her into his web of corruption and exploitation, he was about to learn exactly how stubborn a runner from the Crumb could be.

"Tomorrow," she said quietly, "we'll go in clean. Best clothes, respectful attitudes, documentation perfect down to the last comma. Whatever Vorkress wants, we give him every reason to believe we're exactly what we appear to be: a small crew of runners just trying to make an honest living."

"And if he doesn't believe it?" Liss asked.

Pen met her eyes across the table, her dark eyes flashing with determination. "Then we deal with that when it happens."

Outside, the first stars were beginning to appear in the darkening sky, and The Host was settling into its evening rhythms. But something in Pen couldn't shake the feeling of change coming like a storm on the horizon.

As the ale flowed, she caught herself thinking about August. About the pain in his eyes and the careful way he held himself apart from everyone, most of all, her. There was something there, some connection she didn't understand, but every time she tried to reach for it, he pulled away.

Maybe it was better that way. She had enough problems without adding a brooding, gloomy runner to the mix.

But as she raised her ale to her lips, she couldn't shake the memory of how he'd said her name like it meant everything and nothing all at once.
