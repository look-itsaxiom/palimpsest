# Book 1 - Act 1 - Chapter 1: The Runner's Life

The rope bit into Pen's palms as she lowered herself through the crack in the ancient floor, her boots finding purchase on the crumbling edge of what had once been a grand staircase. Three generations ago, this had been someone's home—maybe even a palace, judging by the fragments of colored glass still clinging to the window frames like broken teeth. Now it was just another ruin to strip for anything worth selling.

"Easy down there, Pen," Liss called from above, her voice echoing off the weathered stone walls. "I can hear you breathing hard from up here."

"I'm fine," Pen muttered, though her heart was hammering against her ribs. The drop was deeper than she'd expected, and the shadows below seemed to swallow her torchlight whole. She'd been running ruins for five years now, but the darkness still made her skin crawl.

The rope went slack as her feet touched solid ground. She pulled her torch higher, casting wavering light across a chamber that made her whistle low under her breath. Murals covered every inch of the walls—faded but still vibrant enough to show scenes of people in flowing robes, their faces turned toward something in the center of each painting that had been deliberately scratched away.

"What've you got?" Armen's voice drifted down, tight with excitement. At nineteen, he was the youngest of their crew, and still got wound up like a spring before every find.

"Murals," Pen called back, running her fingers along the carved stone. "Good condition. The Guild'll pay well for documentation of these." She pulled out her sketching pad and charcoal, working quickly to capture the style and subject matter. The Antiquities Guild paid by the piece for anything that helped them understand the civilization that had built Hartia before the great collapse, but they paid even better for intact artwork.

The chamber branched off in three directions. Pen chose the middle passage, following the beam of her torch through a corridor lined with small alcoves. Most were empty, but she found a few ceramic vessels that had somehow survived three generations of scavengers. She wrapped them carefully in the cloth padding from her pack, checking each one for cracks before stowing them away.

"Pen!" Liss's voice carried an edge of urgency that made Pen's head snap up. "Company topside. Looks like Crust."

Pen cursed under her breath. The last thing they needed was some noble's brat deciding to play at ruin-running on their territory. She'd seen it before—rich kids from the governmental district who thought exploring ruins was some kind of romantic adventure, at least until they ran into their first mutated creature or unstable floor.

She made her way back to the rope, stuffing her finds into her pack as she climbed. The ascent was harder than the descent, her muscles burning as she hauled herself up hand over hand. By the time she emerged into the pale afternoon light, sweat was beading on her forehead despite the cool air.

Liss was crouched behind a chunk of fallen masonry, her alchemist's satchel within easy reach. At twenty-six, she was only three years older than Pen, but she carried herself with the confidence of someone who'd been mixing volatile compounds since she could hold a beaker. Her dark hair was braided back from her face, revealing the small scar on her left temple where a glass explosion had caught her during her apprenticeship.

"How many?" Pen whispered, settling beside her.

"Three. Two guards and someone in silk who's definitely never done manual labor in their life." Liss nodded toward the ruins' main entrance, where three figures were picking their way through the rubble. "The silk one keeps pointing at things and talking about 'historical significance.'"

Pen squinted at the group. The guards wore the blue and gold livery of one of the Crust families, though she couldn't tell which one from this distance. The third figure was young, maybe Armen's age, with elaborately styled hair that probably took their servant an hour to arrange each morning.

"We could wait them out," suggested Jace, their fourth crew member. He was sitting with his back against a broken column, cleaning his fingernails with a dagger that had seen better days. At thirty-one, he was the oldest of their group, and the most cynical. "Let them poke around, get bored, go home to their soft beds."

"And lose a full day's work?" Pen shook her head. "We've got quotas to meet."

The truth was, they needed every coin they could squeeze from this run. The Antiquities Guild's tithe took forty percent of everything they brought in, and that was before they paid for supplies, equipment repairs, and the bribes that kept Guildmaster Vorkress from assigning them the worst territories. Pen had been saving for three years to buy her own charter, but at this rate, she'd be middle-aged before she could afford it.

"I'll handle them," she said, standing and dusting off her knees. Her leather breeches were patched in three places, and her boots had been resoled twice, but they were good quality underneath the wear. She'd learned early that looking like a proper runner got better treatment than looking like a street thief.

She made her way through the ruins, stepping carefully over loose stones and twisted metal. The Host was built within the bones of the old civilization, streets and buildings grafted onto whatever remained of the ancient structures. Sometimes Pen wondered what it had been like before the collapse—if the people who'd lived here had any idea what was coming, or if they'd gone to bed one night in a world of wonders and woken up to find it all ash and ruin.

"Excuse me," she called out as she approached the group. The guards' hands moved to their weapons, but the young noble turned with a bright smile that made Pen's teeth ache.

"Oh, wonderful! You must be one of the local experts. I'm Caelynn Thorne, of the Thorne family?" She said it like a question, as if Pen might have missed the importance of the name. "We're conducting a survey of historical sites for my comparative studies thesis."

Pen bit back her first three responses, all of which would have gotten her in trouble with the Guild. "I'm afraid this site is currently under active excavation by a licensed crew. You'll need to submit a request through the Antiquities Guild for access."

Caelynn's smile faltered slightly. "I was told this area was open to the public for educational purposes."

"Told by who?" Pen kept her voice level, but her hand drifted to the short sword at her hip. Academic or not, claim jumpers were claim jumpers.

"Well, I... that is, I assumed..." Caelynn's face was going red in a way that suggested she wasn't used to being challenged. "Do you know who my father is?"

"Should I?"

One of the guards—a thick-necked man with scars on his knuckles—stepped forward. "Show some respect, runner. You're talking to the daughter of Duke Thorne's cousin."

Pen couldn't help herself. She laughed. "The cousin? I'm impressed. That's almost like being related to someone important."

The guard's face darkened, but before he could respond, Caelynn grabbed his arm. "It's fine, Marcus. We'll... we'll file the proper paperwork." She shot Pen a look that could have melted iron. "Come along."

They retreated with less dignity than they'd arrived with, the guards muttering under their breath about knowing their place. Pen watched them go, then turned back to find her crew standing at the entrance to the ruins, Armen bouncing on his toes with barely contained energy.

"Think they'll be back?" Liss asked.

"Maybe. But not today." Pen shouldered her pack. "Come on. We've got work to do."

They spent the next three hours systematically clearing the ruins, working from room to room with the practiced efficiency of a crew that had been together for two years. Armen found a cache of metal tools in what had probably been a workshop, their edges still sharp despite the years. Jace discovered a hidden compartment containing a collection of small jade figurines that would fetch a good price from the right collector. Liss documented everything in her meticulous hand, noting locations and conditions for the Guild's records.

Pen found herself drawn back to the murals in the deep chamber. There was something about the way the faces turned toward those scratched-out central figures that nagged at her. She'd seen similar damage in other ruins—always the same careful, deliberate destruction of specific elements. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to erase whatever those images had shown.

"Pen?" Armen's voice echoed from somewhere deeper in the complex. "You need to see this."

She followed the sound through a narrow passage she hadn't noticed before, emerging into a circular room with a domed ceiling. Armen was standing in the center, holding his torch high, his face pale in the flickering light.

The walls were covered in text—line after line of carved symbols that seemed to shift and dance in the torchlight. Pen had seen the old language before, fragments and pieces scattered throughout the ruins, but never anything this extensive.

"Can you read any of it?" Armen whispered.

Pen shook her head. The Guild had scholars who specialized in the old tongue, but their services cost more than a runner's crew could afford. "We'll document it and let the experts sort it out."

But as she started sketching the symbols, something strange happened. The carved lines seemed to blur and shift, and for just a moment, she could almost—

_Run._

The word formed in her mind with perfect clarity, though she had no idea where it came from. Her hand stilled on the paper, charcoal suspended halfway through a symbol.

"Did you say something?" she asked Armen.

He shook his head, eyes still fixed on the walls. "Just thinking out loud."

But Pen was sure she'd heard something. A voice she didn't recognize, urgent and afraid. She forced herself to keep drawing, copying each symbol as precisely as she could, but the feeling of wrongness continued to grow. The air in the chamber felt thick, pressing against her lungs like water.

_They're coming._

This time there was no mistaking it. The voice was definitely not Armen's, and it was definitely inside her head. Pen dropped her charcoal and grabbed Armen's arm.

"We need to go. Now."

"What? Why?" But he must have seen something in her face, because he didn't argue when she pushed him toward the passage.

They made it back to the main chamber just as Liss's sharp whistle echoed through the ruins—the signal for immediate evacuation. Pen's blood went cold. Liss didn't panic. If she was calling for a retreat, something was seriously wrong.

They climbed out of the ruins to find Jace and Liss crouched behind the broken wall, staring toward the road that led back to The Host. In the distance, Pen could see a group of figures approaching—too many to be Caelynn's academic expedition, and moving with too much purpose to be casual travelers.

"Guild enforcers," Jace said grimly. "Six of them, and they look like they mean business."

Pen's stomach dropped. Guild enforcers only showed up when someone had been accused of violating their contract—working outside their assigned territory, concealing finds, or failing to pay the proper tithe. The penalties ranged from heavy fines to permanent license revocation, depending on the offense.

"What did we do?" Armen's voice cracked slightly.

"Nothing," Pen said firmly, though her mind was racing through their recent runs, looking for anything that might have raised suspicions. "We've been clean. All our paperwork's in order, all our finds properly documented."

But even as she said it, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was connected to the voice in the carved chamber. To the scratched-out faces in the murals. To the growing sense that they'd stumbled into something much bigger than a routine salvage run.

"Options?" Liss asked quietly.

Pen looked around at her crew—her family, really, the only people who'd stood by her since she'd started running. Armen with his eager energy and dreams of adventure. Jace with his hard-earned cynicism and unwavering loyalty. Liss with her sharp mind and steady hands, who'd pulled them out of more scrapes than Pen could count.

Whatever was coming for them, they'd face it together.

"We pack up everything we can carry and get back to the city," she said. "If the Guild wants to talk, we'll talk. But we're not doing it out here where no one can witness what happens."

They moved quickly, gathering their tools and finds with the efficiency of long practice. The carved chamber would have to wait—there was no time to document the rest of the symbols, no matter how much they might be worth. As they loaded their packs, Pen found herself looking back toward the ruins, toward the answers that were now out of reach.

The voice in her head had gone quiet, but she could still feel its presence, like a word on the tip of her tongue that she couldn't quite remember. Whatever those symbols had said, whatever those scratched-out figures had represented, someone wanted them to stay buried.

And that, more than anything else, made Pen determined to find out why.

The walk back to The Host took them through the outer districts where the city's patchwork nature was most obvious. Ancient stone foundations supported walls of newer timber and scavenged metal, creating a maze of narrow streets that doglegged around collapsed buildings and repurposed ruins. The air smelled of smoke and cooking food, underlaid with the perpetual dust that seemed to settle on everything in the outer reaches.

They passed through the Crumb first, where the city's poorest residents eked out a living in the shadow of the old civilization's grandest structures. Children played in the ruins of what had once been a great amphitheater, their laughter echoing off cracked marble steps. Women hung laundry from lines strung between broken columns, the bright fabric a sharp contrast to the weathered stone.

Pen had grown up here, in a two-room apartment built into what had probably been a storage vault. Her parents had worked as day laborers when work was available, picking through ruins for anything worth selling to the Guild or the private collectors who operated in the city's gray markets. She remembered being five years old and helping them sort through fragments of pottery and broken jewelry, learning to tell the difference between worthless debris and pieces that might feed them for a week.

"Guild post's buzzing," Jace observed as they entered the lower market district. Sure enough, there were more people than usual hanging around the building where runners came to register their finds and pay their tithes. Clusters of license-holders stood in tight groups, voices low and urgent.

"Think word's gotten out about the enforcers?" Liss asked.

"Word always gets out," Pen replied. The runner community was small and tight-knit, bound together by shared risks and the Guild's iron grip on their livelihoods. News traveled fast, especially bad news.

They made their way through the market, past stalls selling everything from fresh bread to ancient artifacts of questionable provenance. Pen nodded to familiar faces—other runners, merchants who bought finds on the side, information brokers who sold maps and rumors for the right price. This was her world, built on the bones of the old one, held together by determination and hope and the stubborn refusal to give up.

As they approached the Guild post, Pen caught sight of a familiar figure leaning against the building's entrance. August stood with his arms crossed, dark hair falling across his forehead, watching the crowd with the kind of lazy attention that meant he was cataloging everything he saw. He was alone, as usual—August went through partners faster than most runners went through rope, and his reputation for abandoning anyone who slowed him down was legendary.

Their eyes met across the square, and Pen felt that familiar spike of irritation. August had a way of looking at her that suggested he knew something she didn't, and it never failed to set her teeth on edge.

"Trouble?" he asked as they approached.

"Nothing we can't handle," Pen replied coolly. August had a talent for showing up when things went sideways, and she'd never been sure if it was coincidence or if he had sources of information that other runners lacked.

He pushed off from the wall, falling into step beside them as they entered the Guild post. "Heard there were enforcers asking questions about unauthorized excavations in the outer ruins."

Pen kept her expression neutral, but her pulse quickened. If August knew about the enforcers, then everyone would know soon enough. "Any idea what they're looking for?"

"Someone's been working outside their assigned territories. Taking finds without proper documentation." August's voice was carefully casual, but Pen caught the warning in his tone. "The kind of thing that gets licenses revoked permanently."

"Good thing we're not that stupid," Armen said, but his voice was tight with nervousness.

August glanced at him, then back at Pen. "No, I don't think you are."

There was something in his tone that made Pen look at him more closely. August was known for his sardonic humor and his tendency to needle other runners, but right now he seemed almost... concerned? It was so unlike him that she found herself studying his face, looking for some clue to what he was really thinking.

"Why do you care?" she asked bluntly.

August's mouth quirked in what might have been a smile. "Who says I care? Maybe I just enjoy watching other people's problems."

But he stayed with them as they made their way through the Guild post's crowded main hall, past the bulletin boards covered with job postings and territory assignments, past the long counter where runners lined up to register their finds and pay their tithes. The building had been a temple once, its high ceilings and elaborate stonework still visible beneath layers of Guild bureaucracy.

Pen found an empty table near the back of the hall and spread out their documentation—maps, sketches, and the careful inventory Liss had maintained throughout their run. Everything was in order, exactly as it should be, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. Some detail she'd overlooked, some connection she'd failed to make.

As she worked, she found herself thinking about the voice in the carved chamber. About the scratched-out faces in the murals. About the way August kept glancing at her when he thought she wasn't looking.

The feeling that she was missing something important continued to grow, pressing against the edges of her consciousness like a word she couldn't quite remember. Whatever was happening, whatever the enforcers were really looking for, Pen had the unsettling certainty that her crew had stumbled into the middle of it.

And somehow, she didn't think it was going to end with a simple conversation at the Guild post.

The bureaucrat who reviewed their paperwork was a thin, nervous man named Clerrick who'd been processing runner documentation for longer than Pen had been alive. His fingers were permanently stained with ink, and he had a habit of muttering under his breath as he worked through each form.

"Territory assignment... correct. License verification... in order. Find documentation..." He paused, squinting at Liss's careful sketches of the murals. "Interesting. Very detailed work."

"Is there a problem?" Pen asked.

"No, no. Just unusual to see artwork of this quality from the outer ruins. Most of what we get from that sector is pottery fragments and the occasional tool." Clerrick made a note in the margin of his ledger. "These murals—did you notice any recurring motifs? Symbols that appeared multiple times?"

Pen thought about the scratched-out central figures, about the way every face in the murals had been turned toward something that was no longer there. "Some deliberate damage. Old damage, probably from when the site was first abandoned."

"Hmm." Clerrick's pen hovered over the page. "And you documented the damaged areas as well?"

"Of course." Pen kept her voice level, but something in the bureaucrat's tone was setting off alarm bells. "Standard procedure."

"Indeed. Well, everything appears to be in order." Clerrick stamped their forms with more force than necessary. "Your tithe comes to two gold sovereigns and eight silver marks."

Pen counted out the coins, trying not to wince at how much of their earnings disappeared into the Guild's coffers. After equipment costs and supply replacement, they'd have enough left over to eat for the rest of the week and maybe save a few coppers toward their charter fund.

As they gathered up their paperwork, Clerrick cleared his throat. "One more thing. Guildmaster Vorkress wanted to speak with any runners who'd been working the outer ruins recently. Something about coordination with a new archaeological survey."

Pen's blood went cold, but she forced herself to nod calmly. "Of course. When would he like to see us?"

"Tomorrow morning. His office, first bell after dawn."

They left the Guild post in silence, walking through the early evening crowds toward the tavern where their crew usually gathered after a successful run. The streets were busier now, filled with people heading home from work or emerging for the night's entertainment. Lanterns cast pools of yellow light across the cobblestones, and the air was rich with the smell of roasting meat and fresh bread.

But Pen barely noticed any of it. Her mind was racing, trying to piece together the connections between the enforcers, the archaeological survey, and the voice she'd heard in the carved chamber. The timing was too convenient to be coincidence.

"Pen." Liss fell into step beside her, voice low enough that the others couldn't hear. "That bureaucrat was asking very specific questions about the murals."

"I noticed."

"And this meeting with Vorkress..." Liss shook her head. "He's never wanted to coordinate with runners before. His usual approach is to take what he wants and worry about the paperwork later."

Pen knew Liss was right. Guildmaster Vorkress was a man who'd climbed to his position through a combination of political connections and careful blackmail, and he had about as much interest in archaeological surveys as he did in honest bookkeeping. If he wanted to see them, it wasn't about coordination.

"Maybe we should think about taking a vacation," Jace suggested. "Visit my cousin in Versci for a few weeks. Let whatever this is blow over."

"Run away, you mean," Armen said, his voice sharp with disappointed pride. "That's your solution to everything."

"My solution is staying alive long enough to spend the money we earn," Jace shot back. "You might want to consider the benefits."

"Enough," Pen said quietly, but with enough authority to cut through their argument. "We're not running. We haven't done anything wrong, and we're not going to act like we have."

But even as she said it, she could feel the weight of the voice in her head, the memory of symbols that had seemed to shift and move in the torchlight. They might not have done anything wrong, but they'd definitely stumbled into something that someone wanted to keep hidden.

And tomorrow morning, she was going to find out exactly what that was.

The tavern was a converted section of what had once been a public bath, its high ceilings and elaborate tilework now warmed by hearth fires and filled with the comfortable noise of conversation and laughter. Pen found a table in the back corner, where they could talk without being overheard, and ordered a round of ale and whatever the kitchen was serving.

As they ate, she found herself studying her crew—really looking at them, maybe for the first time in months. Armen with his eager energy and dreams of adventure, still young enough to believe that wanting something badly enough was the same as being able to achieve it. Jace with his scarred hands and careful cynicism, who'd taught her more about reading people than any amount of street experience. Liss with her quiet intelligence and unshakeable loyalty, who'd stood by her through every crisis and celebration of the past two years.

These were her people. Her family. And if something was coming for them, she was going to make sure they were ready for it.

"Tomorrow," she said quietly, "we go in clean. Best clothes, respectful attitudes, documentation perfect down to the last comma. Whatever Vorkress wants, we give him every reason to believe we're exactly what we appear to be—a small crew of runners trying to make an honest living."

"And if he doesn't believe it?" Liss asked.

Pen met her eyes across the table. "Then we deal with that when it happens."

Outside, the first stars were beginning to appear in the darkening sky, and The Host was settling into its evening rhythms. But Pen could feel change coming like a storm on the horizon, and she had the unsettling certainty that by this time tomorrow, nothing would be the same.

The voice in her head might have gone quiet, but she could still feel its presence—a promise or a warning, she couldn't tell which. All she knew was that whatever answers lay buried in those ruins, someone was very determined to make sure they stayed that way.

And that, more than anything else, made her absolutely certain she was going to dig them up.
